# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data. Examples include:
- Classification (spam detection, image recognition)
- Regression (price prediction, weather forecasting)

### Unsupervised Learning
The algorithm finds patterns in unlabeled data:
- Clustering (customer segmentation)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA)

### Reinforcement Learning
The agent learns by interacting with an environment:
- Game playing (AlphaGo)
- Robotics control

## Getting Started
To begin your ML journey, start with Python and libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

Happy learning!
